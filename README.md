# room-of-cats
a program describing a room of cats which can hold up to seven cats, each time a
key (e.g. Enter) is pressed. Each cat is an object instantiated from class Cat - defined in file
lab2_cats.h. Each cat object, when dynamically instantiated, randomly chooses a fur (i.e., “black”, “grey”, or “brown”), an eye colour (i.e., “green”, “blue”, or “brown”) and a hair
length (i.e., “short” or “long”). Provide get and set methods for these attributes. Carefully
consider which get and set methods should be public and which should be private – all member
functions are defined in file lab2_cats.cpp.
Certain combinations of cats result in fights breaking out.
